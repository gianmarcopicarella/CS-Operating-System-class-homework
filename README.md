# Operating systems homeworks
This is a series of homeworks I worked on during the "Sistemi operativi" class at Sapienza.

## What the homeworks are all about?
- The first homework was about the bash scripting language. More specifically we were required to code a unix process scheduler and a routine to copy recursively folders and files from one location to another
- The second homework was about the C programming language. In this case we were required to code the unix instruction "ls"
- The third and last homework was about the Awk parsing language. We were required to parse and turn a file from one format to another specific one
